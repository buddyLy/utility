To effectively write your code to ease debugging
* functionalize your code through separation of concerns, will help with code reusability as well
* check return code of all commands, either have warning or error out completely  
* when command erred out, log the error message by redirecting standard error to std out
* log out message include timestamp, process id, program name 
* have separate error file and regular log file, log out line numbers when encounter error
* declare variable as local

Good practices
* have cleanup function, including purge process 
* when writing large files to directory, check for acceptable disk size
* have retry logic up to x times 
* have max number of errors to gracefully kill programs
* signal trapping to capture why program exit, such as someone accidentlly ctrl-c, or administrator kills it, or kill by another program 


single responsibility
